# Cloud
Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.
Earlier Internet diagrams denoted Internet as big cloud, which might have given name to this model.


## 

 Four major attributes of Cloud
* On-Demand
* Scalable
* Self-Service
* Measurable

## Types
1. Public
1. Private
1. Hybrid
1. Community

|Traditional on-premises | Modern cloud  |
|---|---|
| Monolithic, centralized | Decomposed, de-centralized|
| Relational database  | Polyglot persistence (mix of storage technologies) | 
|Design for predictable scalability   | Design for elastic scale	  |
| Strong consistency  | Eventual consistency  | 
| Serial and synchronized processing  | Parallel and asynchronous processing   | 
| Design to avoid failures (MTBF)  | Design for failure (MTTR)  | 
| Occasional big updates  | Frequent small updates  | 
| Manual management  | Automated self-management  | 
| Snowflake servers | Immutable infrastructure|
