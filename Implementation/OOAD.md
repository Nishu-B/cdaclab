# Object Oriented Analysis and Design 

* __Class__ – A class defines the blue print i.e. structure and functions of an object.
* __Objects__ – Objects help us to decompose large systems and help us to modularize our system. Modularity helps to divide our system into understandable components so that we can build our system piece by piece. An object is the fundamental unit (building block) of a system which is used to depict an entity.
* __Inheritance__ – Inheritance is a mechanism by which child classes inherit the properties of their parent classes.
* __Abstraction__ – Mechanism by which implementation details are hidden from user.
* __Encapsulation__ – Binding data together and protecting it from the outer world is referred to as encapsulation.
* __Polymorphism__ – Mechanism by which functions or entities are able to exist in different forms.
