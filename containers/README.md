# Containers

## Docker

### Runtime
A collection of software processes unified by one namespace, with access to underlying operating system that it shares with other containers running on same host but no access to each other.

### Image
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
