### Microservices

The goal of the microservice architecture is to accelerate software development by enabling continuous delivery/deployment.

1. Contains Code & State
1. Independent Deployable
1. Autonomous Service

It is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are

* Loosely coupled
* Independently deployable
* Organized around business capabilities.
The microservice architecture enables the continuous delivery/deployment of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.
